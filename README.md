Three-Level Password System
Nowadays, we have known that computer security mostly depends on passwords to verify and authenticate users. There are many authentication schemes proposed and most of them still have weaknesses. Some of them are based on the physical and behavioural properties of the user such as voice recognition, and some others are based on knowledge of the user such as textual and graphical passwords. However, these schemes are still not secure enough and allow attackers to steal the data easily.
